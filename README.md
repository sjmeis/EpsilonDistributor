# EpsilonDistributor
Code repository for the CODASPY 2025 paper: *Spend Your Budget Wisely: Towards an Intelligent Distribution of the Privacy Budget in Differentially Private Text Rewriting*

## Contents
This repository contains two main files:

- `EpsilonDistributor.py`: source code for our proposed distribution toolkit
- `eval.py`: modules for privacy evaluation as reported in our work

The evaluation procedure for utility and empirical privacy is outlined in our work.

## DP Rewriting Mechanisms
We utilize two mechanisms in our work, [1-Diffractor](https://github.com/sjmeis/Diffractor) and [DP-BART](https://github.com/trusthlt/dp-bart-private-rewriting), which are publicly available at the provided links.
